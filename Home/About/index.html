              One of the highest rungs in Onitsha traditional society ladder is
              attained through the acquisition of the Ozo title. Ozo is an
              expensive title whose premier function is to confer on its
              recipient the priesthood of the ancestral cult. Apart from this
              primary objective, Ozo elevates one from the status of commoner to
              that of an aristocrat, making him a member of an exclusive club -
              the, Agbalanze. Ozo starts off with Ikpa mmuo a solemn, sacred
              rite which gradually broadens out into mmacha, a lively secular
              function. To qualify for initiation, a candidate must have
              performed the ceremony of inyedo mmuo. The ceremony involves the
              consecration by the okpala, chief priest if the candidates family,
              of ikenga, chi, ofo, and okposi, carved emblems of ikenga ( the
              candidates god of fortune) chi ( his personal god, somewhat like
              the guardian angel of the Christian religion), ofo ( his god of
              righteousness), and his ancestral spirits . Consecrated, the
              carvings become the place where these spirits will repose in the
              candidates house. The acquisition of the ndi mmuo, as they are
              collectively known. Is an essential; for it is at their alter that
              the final ordination rites are performed. It is here, too, that
              the candidate will, after his ordination, make annually a
              sacrifice of a goat to the spirits.

              The candidate next causes a series of peace offerings ( igo mmuo)
              to make on his behalf by the senior priests of his paternal and
              maternal families. These offerings serve to notify the spiritual
              elements of his intention to be initiated and to invite their
              blessings. The offerings are followed by the payment of the
              initiation fee which runs as high as £700 (1964) This amount is
              shared by member of the Agbalanze Society within the extended
              family ( preferably his own) through which he chooses to attain
              membership in the society. This feature of Ozo title taking gives
              membership in the Agbalanze an added attraction. For as long as
              men aspire after the title within the extended family lineage
              through which the candidate attains his ambition, there is the
              chance of recovering all his initiation expenses and more.
              Besides, it offers him a measure of security in his old age.

              Usually the ordination to priesthood takes place on the day the
              initiation fee is paid. All the Agbalanze in the extended family
              assemble at the home of the chief priest of the candidates family
              for the ceremony which is presided over by all the chief priests
              in his extended family. Transferring his osisi ( staff of office)
              to his left hand, each chief priest takes a kola nut in his right
              hand and they pray simultaneously. After prayers, each breaks his
              kola nut and offers the candidate a piece. The remaining pieces
              are pooled together and distributed among all present. Next, each
              chief priest invites the candidate to a drink. This is followed by
              prayers for the members of his family, then others disperse. The
              Agbalanze retire with the candidate to his house where the
              ordination, ( ikpa mmuo or isi mmanya) is conducted. Immediately
              the ordination is over. The novitiate, now designated an mkpalo
              performs his first first religious service, that of pouring a
              libation of corn beer to his ikenga, chi, ofo and ancestral
              spirits. Next, a goat is sacrificed in thanksgiving.

              When he has attained this level, a novitiate could pause for as
              long as is necessary for him to find the money to carry through
              the next and final stage. Until then he is entitled to preside at
              ceremonial functions within his family and extended family, but
              only when delegated to do so by the chief priest. Normally it is
              customary to allow one week between the attainment of the mkpalo
              stage and the next stage, the mmacha. The ozo dance, the climax of
              the mmacha, the social side of the initiation, generally takes
              place on an oye weekday. Before it, the novitiate secures the
              services of his relations since it involves plenty of work. He
              then invites every ozo title holder who is in town to dance. On
              the eve of the day of the dance, able bodied Agbalanze throughout
              the town arrive at the novitiate residence. After the have been
              presented with kola nuts, then a meal is served. After dinner, the
              candidate dressed in white attire and the Agbalanze from his
              extended family retire to the nze shrine where the ceremony of
              iwalu ozo ( acquiring ozo ) is performed. Towards the end the
              candidate is rubbed all over with white chalk, a symbol of purity.
